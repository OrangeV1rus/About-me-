        <div>
            <h10>Hi there! I’m Jacob Ye, a 16-year-old high school student passionate about technology, creativity, and self-growth. I’ve always had a curiosity for how things work, whether it's coding a website, exploring different software, or building small electronics. My interest in tech led me to start learning web development, and now I'm working on my personal projects ranging from interactive websites to basic apps.

                Apart from tech, I’m also a huge fan of fitness and sports, which keeps me energized. Running and basketball are my go-to activities to stay active and clear my mind. I find the discipline and focus I gain from sports also help me in other areas of life, especially in learning new skills and setting goals.
                
                On a more personal level, I value authenticity and growth. I'm always eager to learn, whether through new experiences, meeting people with different perspectives, or reading books that inspire me. Currently, I’m diving into self-development books and philosophy to help shape my worldview.
                
                Outside of school and hobbies, I love spending time with friends and family. I’m also into photography, and you’ll often catch me snapping nature photos when I’m out on walks or hikes.
                
                That’s a bit about me. Thanks for visiting my page!</h10>
